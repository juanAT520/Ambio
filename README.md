# Ambio
This website is only looking for two things, good aesthetics and relaxation. Written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to use?
You need to download the files and images just like they are in this repository. Then open the 'index.html' in your browser, choose the sound you want to hear and enjoy.
Also you can set the time at which you want the playback to stop by clicking the watch icon, setting the hour and then click on the confirm button.
